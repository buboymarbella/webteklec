                <p> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative 
                and hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</p>
                
                <h2>Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
                    <p>Tim Berners-Lee made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989, 
                       Tim Berners-Lee implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
                       client and server via the Internet

                <h3> Message Headers </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>General - General header fields can be used by both the client and the server.</li>
                    <li>Request - Request header fields are client exclusive.</li>
                    <li>Response - Response header fields are server exclusive.</li>
                    <li>Entity - Entity header fields describe the payload of the request or response.</li>
                </ul>



                <div class='httpmesheadfield'>
                    <h3>HTTP Message Header Fields:</h3>

                    <button class='gen' onclick="hidegenHead()">GENERAL</button>
                    <ul id='genhead' style='display:none;'>
                        <li>Cache-Control - is used by all caching mechanisms to indicate directives that must be followed along a request and response chain. The directives indicated by the Cache-control header field can override the default caching alorithms used by a server or client.</li>
                        <li>Connection - The connection header field allows the sender to indicate what are desired for the connection to be made. The value of the connection header field is called the connection token.</li>
                        <li>Date - Represents the date and time at which the response or request was created.</li>
                        <li>Pragma - Pragma is used to indicate implementation-specific directives. The directives specify certain behavior from the protocol although some needs to be consistent.</li>
                        <li>Trailer - If the Trailer header field is present it means that the client is willing to accept trailer fields.</li>
                        <li>Transfer-encoding - This header field indicates the type of modification or transformation used on the message body in order to send it to the reciever.
                        </li>
                        <li>Upgrade - Specifies what the client is capable of handling and requests the switch to a much higher version or a different protocol. The server responds with a 101(Switching Protocols) code if possible.</li>
                        <li>Via - Works much like the "Upgrade" header field. It states the additional communication protocols that the client is capable of handling. If the server finds the request as viable it will respond with a 101(Switching Protocols) code.
                        </li>
                        <li>Warning - Used to specify changes in the message which may not be reflected in the message as it is rendered. It states additional information regarding the transformation of the body.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <button onclick="hidereqHead()">REQUEST</button>
                    <ul id='reqhead' style='display:none;'>
                        <li>Accept - used to specify media types that are acceptable for the response and indicates that the request is fixed to a small set of desired types.</li>
                        <li>Accept-charset - indicates character sets that are acceptable for the response and allows users capable of learning special character sets to signal that capability to a server which can be used for representing documents in a specific character set.</li>
                        <li>Accept-encoding - similar to accept, the difference is that it restricts the codings that are acceptable in the response.</li>
                        <li>Accept-Language - similar to accept, the difference is that it restrics the languages that are acceptable in the response.</li>
                        <li>Authorization - a user agent that authenticates itself usually with a server but it is unnecessary to do so. This field consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent. </li>
                        <li>Expect - indicates particular behaviors of the server that are required by the user.</li>
                        <li>From - this should contain an e-mail address of the user who manipulates the requesting user agent.</li>
                        <li>If-Match - this field is used with a method to make it conditional where a user has one or more entities involved or received from the resource. </li>
                        <li>If-Modified-Since - is used with a method to make it conditional: if the request was not modified since the said time in this field, no entities will be returned from the server i.e. If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT </li>
                        <li>If-None-Match is used where a user that has one or more entities received from the resource can verify that none of the them are current by including a list of their entity tags that are associated in the header field. </li>
                        <li>If-Range - is used with the GET method that if a user has a partial copy of an entity in its cache and that wishes to have an updated copy of the entity.</li>
                        <li>If-Unmodified-Since - similarly like if-modified-since, it only sends a response that the entity has not been modified and works only when the server has last modified values associated with the object.</li>
                        <li>Max-forward - is used to limit the number of gateways that can forward the request to the next server.</li>
                        <li>Proxy-Authorization - request header contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent to a proxy, concerned with the status 407 Proxy Authentication that the server responded.</li>
                        <li>Range - indicates a specific part of a document or object the the server should return. Many parts can be requested at the same time and may be returned in a document that has multiple parts.</li>
                        <li>Referrer - a request header that contains the address of the previous web page that contains the link of the current page requested. </li>
                        <li>User-Agent - is a request header which identifies the client, it tells the server what client software is being used, or browser is being used.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <button class='res' onclick="hideresHead()">RESPONSE</button>
                    <ul id='reshead' style='display:none;'>
                        <li>Accept-Ranges - it is a marker in the Response HTTP header. It advertise its support of partial request that is used by the server. With the presence of this header, it will try to continue the interrupted download rather than to install it from the beginning.</li>
                        <li>E-Tag - entity tag that is part of the HTTP, it is a protocol for the World Wide Web. It is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for web cache validation, that allows a client to make conditional requests. </li>
                        <li>Location - it is a header field that is returned in response from an HTTP server in two conditions one is a) to ask a web browser to load a different web page and b) to provide information about the location of a newly created resource.</li>
                        <li>Proxy-Authenticate - it is a request-header field that allows the client to identify or verify itself or its user to a proxy which requires authentication</li>
                        <li>Retry-After - it is a response in HTTP header that indicates how long the user agent should wait before making a request again or follow-up request</li>
                        <li>Server - t is a simple zero â€“ configuration command-line. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it is very simple.</li>
                        <li>Vary - it is a response header that determines how to handle or match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used or it needed to request a new one from the origin server. </li>
                        <li>WWW-Authenticate - it is a response header that shows the authentication method to gain access to a resource </li>
                    </ul>
                    <button class='ent' onclick="hideentHead()">ENTITY</button>
                    <ul id='enthead' style='display:none;'>
                        <li>Allow - This entity header lists all the methods(i.e. GET, PUT, DELETE) that the user-agent is capable of using in a given resource. It is stated to inform the user of what methods is available for use. It is a must to include this header in a 405(Method Not Allowed) response statement.</li>
                        <li>Content-encoding - This entity header field is used to specify to the browser what type of compressing method is used in the resource file. As some files are too large to be sent in their original media-type. This field indicates what type of encoding was applied to identify the decoding to be used in order to get the file extension specified by the media-type field. i.e. Content-Encoding: zip Content-Encoding: gzip</li>
                        <li>Content-language - This entity header indicates the language used in the resource. This may also indicate what language the resource may be displayed in as a Content-Language entity header may have two or more values. The purpose of the header is to inform the user of what audience the entity is intended for. i.e. Content-Language: en, rus, fil;</li>
                        <li>Content-length - This is used to indicate the full size of the entity body in decimal number of octets. Should the user use GET method to get a part of the resource the Content-Length would indicate the full size of the resource. The valid value for this entity header is 0 and above. i.e. Content-Length: 350;</li>
                        <li>Content-location - This is provided by the server to supply the resource location or where the file was fetched from. A server should send the Entity header specially if the resource has multiple associations with it in varying locations because an entity may be accesible through a different URI. i.e. Content-Location: https://www.webtek.org/files/info.txt</li>
                        <li>Content-MD5 - This header field may be generated by a server or client to serve as an integrity check for the resource body. To not defeat the purpose of the Message Integrity Check(MIC) only origin servers and clients are able to generate the tag. An example or one way of checking the integrity of the file is by the number of even or odd bytes in the resource body. If the sent resource byte changed from odd to even or vice-versa the resource is then requested again.</li>
                        <li>Content-range - This entity header field specifies what part of the resource should be fetched by the browser. The user should specify the range to be fetched. To be able to execute the user must follow the correct syntax in specifying the range. i.e. Content-Range = bytes(specification) 500-1000(range)/2000(total);</li>
                        <li>Content-type - This header field states what type of content was sent to the browser. This provides information to the browser on what type of file it is recieving for the browser to be able to render the file properly in its original format. i.e. Content-Type: text/html;</li>
                        <li>Expires - This entity header field indicates the date and time at which the server response is considered stale. A response that is already expired has an Expires entity header field equal to the date header value. For a none expiring response the server sends an Expires entity header field with a value 1 year ahead of the current date/time. i.e. Expires: Mon, 19 Jun 2017 23:59:59 PT;</li>
                        <li>Last Modified - This entity header field indicates the time and date the server thinks the resource was last modified. This is necessary in order for the browser to know if it needs to fetch the resource again due to an update or use the cached version of the resource to save the trouble of fetching the same file again. i.e. Last-Modified: Sun, 18 Jun 2017 08:59:15 PT</li>

            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <h2>CSS History and Origin</h2>
            <p>CSS or <span id="acro">cascading style sheets</span>span> is used for describing the presentation of an html document. Though CSS is not limited to only HTML documents it may also be applied to SVG, XML and XHTML docs.</p>
            <p>CSS was proposed by <span id="name">Hakon Wium Lie</span> at around that time several proposals for style sheet languages was proposed. This led to the <span id="acro1">World Wide Web Consortium</span>'s first CSS Recommendation. As his proposal was influential <span id="name1">Bert Bos</span> became co-author of CSS1</p>
            <br>
            <h2>CSS Variations</h2>
            <ul id="lists">
                <li>CSS 1 - includes font properties, line spacing and text attributes, text colors, backgrounds and positioning options such as margin and paddings.</li>
                <li>CSS 2 - added capabilities for positioning of elements such as relative, absolutes and Z - index. Media type concepts and font properties.</li>
                <li>CSS 2.1 - This first revision of the CSS 2 moves forward by fixing errors and removing not fully supported features from the previous version.</li>
                <li>CSS 3.0 - Preserves backwards compatibility. Now divided into modules. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>CSS Preprocessors and Frameworks</h2>
            <p>As CSS has been around for a long time several frameworks have been built to provide users with predefined set of keywords to use in their css documents. Such as:</p>
            <ul id="lists2">
                <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>CSS is can be seen as an incomplete language. Editing CSS declarations and building a function can be a grueling and repetitive task. That is where Preprocessing CSS comes along. This pre-processors allow for the creation of Variable, Nesting,Mixins and Extensions. Although pre-processors have different syntax they are not too far apart. Here are some of CSS Preprocessors:</p>
            <ul id="lists3">
                <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://stylus-lang.com/">Stylus</a></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
            <p>In CSS in order to refer to an element that we want to style we need to indicate a selector. This can be done in different ways with different selectors.</p>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Selector</th>
                <th>Syntax</th>
                <th>Description</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>type</td>
                <td>p</td>
                <td>Selects a specific element to style</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>class</td>
                <td>.proj</td>
                <td>Selects an element with a matching class attribute</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>id</td>
                <td>#proj</td>
                <td>Selects an element with a matching id attribute</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>*</td>
                <td>*</td>
                <td>Selects all elements</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <h2>CSS Combinators</h2>
            <p>To further specify the element you want to style combinators offer a lot of variations in selecting an element.</p>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Combinators</th>
                <th>Syntax</th>
                <th>Description</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Descendant Selector</td>
                <td>A B</td>
                <td>This combinator selects children of the first specified element even if not direct descendants</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Child Selector</td>
                <td>A &gt; B</td>
                <td>The combinator selects children that are direct descendants of the first specified element</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>General Sibling Selector</td>
                <td>A ~ B</td>
                <td>This combinator selects the latter element that follows after the former element not necessarily immediately</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Adjacent Sibling Selectors</td>
                <td>A + B</td>
                <td>This combinator selects the latter element that follows immediately after the former element</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <h2>CSS Psuedo Elements</h2>
            <p>A Psuedo element allows the user to style specific part of a selected element.Some of them are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>::after - This will be placed after the element.</li>
            <li>::before - This will be placed before the element.</li>
            <li>::first-letter - Only applies to the first letter of the element.</li>
            <li>::first-line - Only applies to the first line of the element.</li>
            <li>::selection - Applies to a portion of a document highlighted by the user.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>CSS Psuedo Classes</h2>
            <p>A Psuedo class is a keyword added to a selector to indicate a special state of the selected element. Such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>:active</li>
                <li>:any</li>

                <li>:first-of-type</li>
                <li>:fullscreen</li>
