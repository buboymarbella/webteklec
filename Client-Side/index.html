        <h2 id="subtopicheader">CSS History and Origin</h2>
        <p id="intro">CSS or <span id="acro">cascading style sheets</span>span> is used for describing the presentation of an html document. Though CSS is not limited to only HTML documents it may also be applied to SVG, XML and XHTML docs.</p>
        <p id="intro">CSS was proposed by <span id="name">Hakon Wium Lie</span> at around that time several proposals for style sheet languages was proposed. This led to the <span id="acro">World Wide Web Consortium</span>'s first CSS Recommendation. As his proposal was influential <span id="name">Bert Bos</span> became co-author of CSS1</p>

        <h2 id="subtopicheader">CSS Variations</h2>
        <ul id="lists">
            <li>CSS 1 - includes font properties, line spacing and text attributes, text colors, backgrounds and positioning options such as margin and paddings.</li>
            <li>CSS 2 - added capabilities for positioning of elements such as relative, absolutes and Z - index. Media type concepts and font properties.</li>
            <li>CSS 2.1 - This first revision of the CSS 2 moves forward by fixing errors and removing not fully supported features from the previous version.</li>
            <li>CSS 3.0 - Preserves backwards compatibility. Now divided into modules. </li>

        <h2 id="subtopicheader">CSS Preprocessors and Frameworks</h2>
        <p>As CSS has been around for a long time several frameworks have been built to provide users with predefined set of keywords to use in their css documents. Such as:</p>
        <ul id="lists">
            <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>CSS is can be seen as an incomplete language. Editing CSS declarations and building a function can be a grueling and repetitive task. That is where Preprocessing CSS comes along. This pre-processors allow for the creation of Variable, Nesting,Mixins and Extensions. Although pre-processors have different syntax they are not too far apart. Here are some of CSS Preprocessors:</p>
        <ul id="lists">
            <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://stylus-lang.com/">Stylus</a></li>
        </ul>
